/**
 * A unit of execution. Spark has two kinds of Macrotasks:
 * - [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapMacrotask]]
 * - [[org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultMacrotask]]
 *
 * Macrotasks are used to ship information from the scheduler to the executor, and are responsible
 * for constructing the monotasks needed to complete the Macrotask.
 *
 * A spark job consists of one or more stages. The very last stage in a job consists of multiple
 * ResultMacrotasks, while earlier stages consist of ShuffleMapMacrotasks. A ResultMacroTask
 * executes the task and sends the task output back to the driver application. A
 * ShuffleMapMacrotask executes the task and divides the task output to multiple buckets (based on
 * the task's partitioner).
