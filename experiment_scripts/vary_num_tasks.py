"""
This script runs jobs that process the same amount of data, but use different
numbers of tasks to do so.

Each job sorts data read from HDFS, and saves the output in HDFS. To vary the
number of tasks, we re-write the input data for each experiment, using a
different number of tasks to write the data (each task writes at least one
partition, so using more tasks forces HDFS to use more partitions).

Before running this experiment, be sure to change the block size in
ephemeral-hdfs/conf/hdfs-site.xml to be 2GB (which is the maximum allowed block size,
and larger than the largest block size used in this experiment).
